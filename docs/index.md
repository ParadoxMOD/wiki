**Welcome to the official Wiki for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)!** This site is still very limited, and under construction. You can view the progress on the [Wiki Planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wIRdj09dGPf28hX6y-YM_uP2Xp78T11raeDPbm21Ee8/edit?usp=sharing). 

**Contribution is highly encouraged.** If you find anything in the game that is not listed in these articles and would like to help, please feel free to hop onto the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MindustryGame/wiki) and open a Pull Request with the changes. If you are new to Markdown, I **strongly** advise you to visit this [beautiful guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) by CommonMark. It has a tutorial (Click "Try our 10-minute Markdown Tutorial") to help you learn Markdown, and a quick reference for the most important aspects of Markdown.
